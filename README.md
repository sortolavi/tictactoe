# Tictactoe

This is old java coursework featuring Swing graphic UI and Minimax algorithm. Just main class with one subclass so there is much to do. Could be useful when playing with software architecture, design patterns or anything imaginable.

Fetch all files, open command line, compile "javac Tictactoe.java", then run "java Tictactoe", that's it!
